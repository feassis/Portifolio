## Introduction

In this post, I want to share my experience building a **virtual RPG table** that allows players and game masters to interact dynamically in real time.  
The project’s backbone is a **RESTful API architecture**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Why RESTful API?

Using a RESTful API provided several benefits:
- A clear and structured way to organize requests.
- Scalability for handling multiple players and sessions.
- Easier maintainability by separating backend and frontend responsibilities.

This separation, however, came at the **cost of usability in the client-side**, since some interactions became slightly more complex to handle compared to a tightly coupled approach.

## Real-Time Communication with SSE

To make the system responsive and dynamic, I integrated **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**:
- The browser uses the **EventSource API** to connect to the server.
- The data stream uses a **well-defined event format**, making communication efficient.
- SSE provided a lightweight, robust solution for delivering **real-time updates** without the overhead of constant polling.

As one author puts it:

> *"The combination of the EventSource API in the browser and the well-defined event stream data format is what makes SSE both an efficient and an indispensable tool for handling real-time data in the browser."*

## Lessons Learned

- **RESTful APIs** work great as the backbone for interactive systems.  
- **SSE** is powerful for real-time updates with minimal complexity.  
- **Frontend and backend separation** improves maintainability, but sometimes impacts usability for the client.  

## Conclusion

The project confirmed that using a **RESTful API** combined with **SSE** is not only viable but also an **efficient and robust solution** for interactive applications — such as virtual RPG tables.

✨ This was a fun project, and I plan to iterate on it by improving the client experience and exploring additional real-time technologies like **WebSockets** or **GraphQL subscriptions**.
