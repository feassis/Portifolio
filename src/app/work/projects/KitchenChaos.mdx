## Overview
*Kitchen Chaos* is a **multiplayer cooperative cooking game** where players must collaborate to prepare and serve meals under time pressure. Inspired by *Overcooked*, the game emphasizes communication, teamwork, and efficient task management to succeed in increasingly chaotic kitchen scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Cooperative mechanics that encourage communication and coordination.  
- **Dynamic Kitchen Layouts**: Levels with shifting obstacles, moving counters, and new challenges.  
- **Time-Pressure Cooking**: Players must manage chopping, cooking, and serving within strict deadlines.  
- **Task Management**: Different player roles (chef, runner, server) allow varied playstyles.  
- **Replayability**: Varied recipes, level layouts, and multiplayer chaos ensure every match is unique.  

## Technologies Used
- **Unity (C#)**: Core development engine.  
- **Netcode for GameObjects**: Multiplayer networking and synchronization.  
- **Git**: Version control and project collaboration.  

## Challenges and Learnings
The main challenge was implementing **synchronized multiplayer systems** while maintaining responsive gameplay under network conditions. Handling player interactions with objects in real time required careful design of authority systems and lag compensation.  

This project strengthened my knowledge in **multiplayer development, state synchronization, and cooperative game design**.  

## Outcome
The project delivered a **fun, chaotic multiplayer cooking experience** where collaboration and quick thinking are key to success. The systems built provided a strong foundation for scaling more complex multiplayer interactions and dynamic level designs.
