## Overview

*Hunter Assassin* is a **top-down stealth game** where players must outmaneuver enemies, use shadows, and strategically eliminate targets without being detected. The game leverages **Finite State Machines (FSM)** to create dynamic AI that reacts to player actions, ensuring a tense and immersive stealth experience.  

## Key Features

- **Stealth-Based Gameplay**: Players rely on cover, shadows, and timing to approach enemies undetected.  
- **State Machine AI**: Implemented FSMs to manage enemy states such as *Idle, Patrol, Alerted,* and *Chasing*, providing reactive and believable AI behavior.  
- **Dynamic Level Design**: Created arenas that encourage strategic thinking, risk-taking, and replayability.  
- **Engaging Enemy Interactions**: AI adapts to player actions, increasing difficulty as more enemies become aware.  
- **Scalable Systems**: Modular FSM structure allows for easy integration of new enemy types and behaviors.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Main engine for development and prototyping.  
- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**: Structured AI behavior system for enemies and stealth logic.  
- **Git**: Version control and project collaboration.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was ensuring that enemy AI felt **both reactive and fair**. Using **FSMs**, I built a flexible system where AI behavior could be tuned for difficulty, while still remaining predictable enough for players to strategize around. This strengthened my understanding of **AI systems and gameplay balance**.  

## Outcome

The project successfully delivered a **stealth-action prototype** with intelligent enemy AI and tense gameplay loops. The FSM architecture ensured scalability for new mechanics and provided a strong foundation for more advanced AI-driven experiences.
