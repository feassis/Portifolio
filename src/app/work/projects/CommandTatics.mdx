## Overview

*Command Tatics* is a tactical JRPG inspired by classic grid-based strategy games. Players command a party of heroes across turn-based battles, making strategic choices that influence combat flow and resource management. The **Command Pattern** was applied to provide a robust and scalable architecture for handling complex player and enemy actions.  

## Key Features

- **Turn-Based Tactical Combat**: Grid-based movement, skill usage, and unit positioning to create deep strategy mechanics.  
- **Command Pattern Architecture**: Implemented actions such as move, attack, and ability usage as commands, enabling undo/redo functionality and streamlined game state management.  
- **Flexible Unit Abilities**: Designed modular skills and abilities that can be easily extended or balanced.  
- **AI Integration**: Enemy units use the same command system, ensuring consistent gameplay logic across players and AI.  
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns using design patterns allowed new mechanics to be integrated seamlessly.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Core engine for development.  
- **Command Pattern**: Structured game actions for maintainable and flexible gameplay logic.  
- **Git**: Version control and project collaboration.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was creating a combat system that could handle both player and AI actions with minimal code duplication. By applying the **Command Pattern**, I ensured that all actions followed a consistent flow, making the system more maintainable and adaptable. This project strengthened my understanding of design patterns in practical game development.  

## Outcome

The project successfully delivered a tactical JRPG prototype with engaging combat and scalable systems. The **Command Pattern** proved crucial for managing complexity, allowing for flexible expansion of features while keeping the codebase clean and structured.
