## Overview

*Angry Monkeys* is a **tower defense game** where players strategically place monkey defenders to stop waves of invading enemies. The project leverages the **Service Locator Pattern** to manage core systems like audio, spawning, and game state management in a decoupled and scalable way, allowing flexible gameplay expansion.  

## Key Features

- **Tower Defense Mechanics**: Players place and upgrade monkey towers to defend against increasingly challenging waves of enemies.  
- **Service Locator Architecture**: Centralized access to game services (audio, enemy spawner, UI, etc.) ensures decoupled systems and easier maintenance.  
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Wave-based enemy progression challenges players with varied enemy types and strategies.  
- **Upgradable Towers**: Multiple tower types with unique attack patterns and upgrade paths.  
- **Replayability**: Modular system design allows for new towers, enemies, and maps to be integrated seamlessly.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Core development engine for the project.  
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Applied for centralized and decoupled service management.  
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was maintaining **scalability and decoupling** as the game introduced multiple services (spawning, audio, UI, etc.). By applying the **Service Locator Pattern**, I streamlined the way components accessed shared services without creating tight dependencies, improving code maintainability and flexibility.  

## Outcome

The project successfully delivered a **tower defense prototype** with scalable mechanics and a maintainable architecture. The **Service Locator Pattern** provided the flexibility to extend the game with new towers, enemies, and maps, making it an excellent showcase of service-oriented design in Unity.
