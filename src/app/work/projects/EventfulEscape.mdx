## Overview

*Eventful Escape* is a horror escape room game where players must solve puzzles and uncover secrets to escape a haunted environment. The game emphasizes atmospheric tension, dynamic interactions, and scalable event-driven systems powered by the **Observer Pattern**.  

## Key Features

- **Escape Room Mechanics**: Players solve interconnected puzzles, unlock clues, and face eerie challenges in a horror-inspired setting.  
- **Observer Pattern Architecture**: Implemented an event-driven system allowing objects and puzzles to react dynamically to player actions.  
- **Immersive Atmosphere**: Integrated sound effects, lighting changes, and environmental triggers to heighten the sense of dread and urgency.  
- **Scalable System Design**: Modular code structure allows new puzzles and interactions to be added seamlessly.  
- **Polish and Optimization**: Debugging and performance tuning ensured smooth interactions across puzzles and environments.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Main development environment for prototyping and implementation.  
- **Observer Pattern**: Applied as the foundation for gameplay events and interactions.  
- **Git**: Version control and collaborative workflows.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was designing an event system that could scale with multiple puzzle interactions without creating spaghetti code. Using the **Observer Pattern** allowed for a clean separation between systems, reducing coupling and making the codebase more maintainable. This experience deepened my understanding of software architecture in games.  

## Outcome

The project successfully delivered an immersive escape room experience where every puzzle feels connected to the environment. The Observer Pattern provided a robust foundation for extending gameplay features, and the game stands out as a technical showcase of modular design in Unity horror projects.
