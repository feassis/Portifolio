## Overview

*Cosmic Curation* is a **space shooter game** where players pilot a customizable ship through waves of enemies in fast-paced battles. The project emphasizes **performance optimization** by applying **Object Pooling** for bullets, enemies, and power-ups, ensuring smooth gameplay even during large-scale encounters.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Space Combat**: Players face waves of enemies with varied attack patterns and behaviors.  
- **Object Pooling System**: Implemented pooling for projectiles, enemies, and effects to reduce instantiation costs and improve runtime performance.  
- **Upgradeable Ship**: Weapons and abilities can be enhanced with collected power-ups.  
- **Enemy Variety**: Different enemy types with unique movement and attack patterns.  
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to handle dozens of entities simultaneously without framerate drops.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Core development engine.  
- **Object Pooling Pattern**: For efficient memory and resource management.  
- **Git**: Version control and project collaboration.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was ensuring that gameplay remained **smooth and performant** even with a high number of projectiles and enemies on screen. Implementing **Object Pooling** significantly improved performance while avoiding memory spikes, reinforcing my skills in **optimization and scalable gameplay design**.

## Outcome

The project delivered a **high-performance space shooter** with responsive controls, exciting combat, and scalable systems. The use of **Object Pooling** allowed for seamless gameplay with minimal performance issues, making the game a strong technical showcase of optimization in Unity.
