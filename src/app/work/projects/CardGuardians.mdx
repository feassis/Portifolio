## Overview

Card Guardians is a roguelike deckbuilding game with RPG elements, developed for mobile platforms. I contributed as a Unity Game Developer, working on gameplay mechanics, system architecture, performance optimization, and ensuring a smooth player experience across devices.  

## Key Features

- **Gameplay Systems**: Implemented and balanced core mechanics for deckbuilding, turn-based combat, and roguelike progression.  
- **Content Integration**: Collaborated with designers and artists to integrate new cards, enemies, and procedural events into the game.  
- **Optimization**: Applied object pooling, memory management, and performance profiling to enhance the gameâ€™s performance on mobile devices.  
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Ensured compatibility and smooth gameplay across Android and iOS platforms.  
- **QA and Debugging**: Actively participated in testing, debugging, and resolving critical issues during development and live updates.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Main engine for game development and cross-platform deployment.  
- **Git**: Version control and collaborative development.  
- **Mobile SDKs**: Integration of analytics, ads, and in-app purchases.  

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was balancing complex card interactions while keeping the game accessible to casual players. I learned to design scalable systems that allow the addition of new content without breaking existing mechanics. Working with cross-disciplinary teams also enhanced my collaboration and communication skills.  

## Outcome

Card Guardians was successfully released on mobile, gaining positive feedback from players for its engaging mechanics and replayability. The project strengthened my expertise in Unity development, system design, and mobile optimization, and remains a highlight of my portfolio as a professional game developer.
