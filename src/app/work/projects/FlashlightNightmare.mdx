## Overview

*Flashlight Nightmare!* is a horror survival game developed during a game jam, where players must navigate a dark labyrinth haunted by creatures and eerie mysteries. With only a flashlight and a phone left behind by their captor, players must survive until sunrise while uncovering secrets and upgrading their tools to escape.  


## Key Features

- **Procedurally Generated Music**: The soundtrack dynamically adapts to the game’s tension, adding to the immersive horror atmosphere.  
- **NPC Dialogue System**: Implemented unique characters with interactive dialogues that provide clues and enrich the labyrinth’s mystery.  
- **Flashlight Upgrade System**: Designed and integrated mechanics allowing players to enhance their flashlight’s abilities for survival.  
- **Core Gameplay**: Worked on player controls, combat interactions, and labyrinth progression logic.  
- **QA and Debugging**: Fixed gameplay bugs, animation issues, and polished mechanics within the jam’s limited timeframe.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Main engine used for development and prototyping.  
- **Git**: Collaboration across a distributed team during the game jam.  
- **Procedural Systems**: Dynamic music and level features tailored to player experience.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The short timeframe of the jam made balancing scope and ambition a challenge. I learned how to prioritize critical gameplay features, collaborate effectively with a multidisciplinary team, and debug under pressure. Working on procedural music and player-driven mechanics was especially rewarding and pushed my creativity as a developer.  

## Outcome

Despite tight deadlines and a few unfinished features, *Flashlight Nightmare!* was successfully completed and showcased during the jam. The game received positive feedback for its atmosphere, tension, and unique procedural systems, and it remains a valuable experience in rapid prototyping, teamwork, and delivering playable builds under constraints.
