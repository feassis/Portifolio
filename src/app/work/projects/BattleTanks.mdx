## Overview

*Battle Tanks* is a **top-down tank combat game** where players control armored vehicles in fast-paced battles. The project was built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between gameplay logic, user interface, and rendering. This structure allowed for scalable development and easier integration of new features.  

## Key Features

- **Tank Combat Mechanics**: Players control tanks with responsive movement, aiming, and projectile-based shooting.  
- **MVC Architecture**: Game state (Model), visuals (View), and controls (Controller) are decoupled, improving maintainability and scalability.  
- **Dynamic Environments**: Destructible obstacles and interactive elements increase tactical depth.  
- **Multiplayer-Friendly Design**: Architecture supports expansion into local or online competitive modes.  
- **Modular Codebase**: Adding new tank types, weapons, or mechanics is streamlined thanks to MVC separation.  

## Technologies Used

- **Unity (C#)**: Main engine for development and implementation.  
- **MVC Architecture**: Applied to structure tank logic, rendering, and player inputs.  
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration.  

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was designing a clean and extensible codebase for handling **multiple tanks and player interactions** simultaneously. By applying **MVC**, I achieved a clear separation between the gameâ€™s logic and its presentation, which reduced code complexity and improved testing. This project enhanced my skills in **software architecture and scalable gameplay design**.  

## Outcome

The project successfully delivered a **fun and modular tank combat prototype**. The MVC structure provided a strong foundation for extending the game with new features, such as different tank classes, varied weapons, and multiplayer support, while maintaining clean and maintainable code.
